I am a global biogeochemical modeller and model developer, ocean and climate scientist with a strong interest in how marine ecosystems are affected by both pollution and climate change. I have a broad background in biological calcification, ecological interactions with open ocean biogeochemistry over paleo timescales, ocean-based climate feedbacks, carbon, nutrient and oxygen cycling and most recently, interactions of microplastics with the base of the ocean food web.
