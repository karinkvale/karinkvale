I am a global biogeochemical modeller and model developer, ocean and climate scientist with a strong interest in how marine ecosystems are affected by both pollution and climate change. I have a broad background in biological calcification, ecological interactions with open ocean biogeochemistry over paleo timescales, ocean-based climate feedbacks, carbon, nutrient and oxygen cycling and most recently, interactions of microplastics with the base of the ocean food web. In addition to my research I am active in the international ocean science community as an editor for [Ocean-Land-Atmosphere-Research](https://spj.science.org/journal/olar), and serve as a member of the [Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS)](https://www.solas-int.org/) Scientific Steering Committee to 2026. I also contribute advice to the ongoing negotiations of the Global Plastics Treaty via the [Scientists' Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty](https://ikhapp.org/scientistscoalition/).
