The longevity of airborne microplastic-climate forcing from legacy plastic pollution (2023-2026) 
Revell L (University of Canterbury, NZ), Evangeliou N (NILU, Norway), Kvale K (ABOR, NZ)

For this project we are estimating the potential radiative forcing for multiple scenarios of microplastic pollution and climate change over the next century using a combination of experimental and modelling methods.

Metal micronutrients: Major players in the Southern Oceanâ€™s carbon sink. (2023-2026) 
Stirling C (University of Otago, NZ), Druce M (University of Otago, NZ), Bostock H (University of Queensland, Australia), Swann G (University of Nottingham, UK), Kvale K (ABOR, NZ)

Here we are investigating the role of zinc, cadmium, and iron co-limitation on the efficiency of the biological carbon pump in the Southern Ocean over glacial cycles.
