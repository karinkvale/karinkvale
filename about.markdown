Aotearoa Blue Ocean Research is a fundamental and applied research consultancy with a focus on open ocean biogeochemical modelling. It is a registered research organisation in New Zealand with a variety of contracts from both government and NGO sectors, and maintains collaborations with major international research institutes. I occasionally accept visiting students and host research projects, but cannot grant academic degrees. Please get in touch if you want to discuss project ideas.
